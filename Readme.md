## About The Project

This project was built to create an interactive and engaging chat experience where users can select a persona of a well-known tech YouTuber (like Hitesh Choudhary or Piyush Garg) and receive answers in their unique style and voice. The frontend is built with simple HTML, Tailwind CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, while the backend is a Node.js Express server that securely communicates with an AI API.

The application is designed for easy deployment on serverless platforms like Vercel.

    cd youtuber-ai-chat-bot
    ```
3.  **Install NPM packages:**
    ```sh

4.  **Create a `.env` file:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add your secret keys. This file should **not** be committed to Git.

    # Your API key from the AI service provider
    OPENAI_API_KEY="your_actual_api_key_here"
